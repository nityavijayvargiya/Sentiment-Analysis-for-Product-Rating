Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that mimic human intelligence. This could be anything from a computer program playing chess, to a voice-recognition system like Amazon's Alexa. AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms. This allows the software to learn automatically from patterns and features in the data. AI is a broad field of study that includes many theories, methods and technologies, as well as the following major subfields: Machine learning automates analytical model building. Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modelled after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language.
